    What is a cappuccino, exactly?<br>
    A cappuccino is an espresso drink with steamed milk, milk foam and espresso. It’s very similar to a latte (cafe latte), but the proportion of steamed milk is different. Here’s the breakdown of a latte vs cappuccino:
    
    A cappuccino has equal parts espresso, steamed milk and foam (⅓ each).<br>
    A latte is ⅓ espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, with a thin layer of foam on top. Here’s a chart that breaks it down!<br>
    The differences between the two drinks are pretty subtle, and so is the flavor. But you’re in luck: the cappuccino is the easier of the two to perfect at home. With a latte you’re looking for microfoam, steamed milk with a wet-paint like texture that’s almost impossible to get without an espresso machine. A cappuccino can easily be made with frothed milk using various tools: even a whisk!
